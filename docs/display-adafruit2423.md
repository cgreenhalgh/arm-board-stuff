# Adafruit 2423 320x240 2.8" TFT + Capacitive Touchscreen

See [here](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2423)

Note, default install scripts only work with Rasbian (or, rather, don't work with Alpine), as they don't support OpenRC as init (and possibly other reasons).

- [easy install](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-2-8-pitft-capacitive-touch/easy-install-2) - can always read the script...

Stuff to update device tree and config should transfer. 
Probably still build/use ftcp to mirror HDMI framebuffer.
