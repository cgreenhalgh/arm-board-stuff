## Boards

Databox is recommending R-Pi 3B+
- w. BCM2837B0 (1.4GHz) quad-core ARM Cortex A53 (ARMv8) cluster
- i.e. Armv8-A architecture
- Two execution states: AArch32 (to execute existing Armv7-A applications) and AArch64 (used by databox)
- Note, all general purpose Arm v8 devices have hardware FP support

## Alpine

Databox is using Alpine 64 bit (aarch64) as default host.
