# Bela stuff

[Bela](http://bela.io/) -Project by QMUL augmented instruments lab- Ultra-low latency audio and sensor processing cape for the Beaglebone

Based on audio/IO cape for [BeagleBone Black](https://beagleboard.org/black) or [Pocket Beagle](https://beagleboard.org/pocket).
BB Black has AM335x 1GHz ARM Cortex-A8 and Pocket Beagle has Octavo Systems OSD3358 1GHz ARM Cortex-A8. 
So both are ARMv7-A (32 bit) with VFPv3 FPU.

Bela uses real-time kernel modifications from another o/s project.
It specifically seems to have debian wheezy and stretch support (stretch is debian current).
